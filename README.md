   ```
3. In the project folder:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Use Expo Go on your phone or run on Android/iOS simulator.

## How to push to your GitHub repo
1. Initialize git if not already:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/chelsa02/Nutricheck.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Nutricheck scaffold"
   git push origin main
   ```

Notes:
- Replace placeholder dependency versions with the latest compatible ones if needed.
- Add app icon/splash images into `assets/`.
